## Natural Language Processing (NLP) with BERT

**Overview**

The project performs semantic analysis on movie reviews using data from one of the most visited websites in the world: IMDB! The semantic analysis is done using the low-code Python library, Ktrain.

Not only is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) a framework that has been pre-trained with the biggest data set ever used, it is also remarkably easy to adapt to different NLP applications, by adding additional output layers. This allows users to create sophisticated and precise models to carry out a wide variety of NLP tasks.

**Learnings:**

- Natural Language Processing
- How to implement the BERT model
- Sentiment Analysis

The code workflow will unfold as follows:

*Part 1: Data Preprocessing*
- Loading the IMDB dataset
- Creating the training and test sets

*Part 2: Building the BERT model*

*Part 3: Training and evaluating the BERT model*
- Getting the learner instance
- Training and evaluating the BERT model
